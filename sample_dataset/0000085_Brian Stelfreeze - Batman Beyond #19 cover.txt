Batman Beyond #19 cover by Brian Stelfreeze: In a high-stakes aerial chase over a futuristic cityscape, Batman, depicted in his signature black and red costume, swoops down to confront two adversaries. One is a man in a trench coat and hat, seemingly in distress, while the other, a woman with fiery red hair, wields a flaming weapon. The helicopter they're in has a unique design, with visible rotor blades and a transparent cockpit.
