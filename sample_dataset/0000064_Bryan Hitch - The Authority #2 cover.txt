The Authority #2 cover by Bryan Hitch portrays a dominant female figure with flowing hair, standing atop a pile of rubble. She holds a baby close to her chest, with a determined expression on her face. Surrounding her are other characters, some of whom appear to be in distress. The overall mood of the artwork is intense and dramatic.
