THE WALKING DEAD #32 by Charlie Adlard, a heavily armored police officer stands defiantly against a backdrop of a bloodied and chaotic urban setting. The officer, wearing a helmet with a reflective visor, is in the midst of a fierce confrontation with three aggressive, undead individuals who appear to be lunging at him. The color palette is dominated by deep purples and reds, evoking a sense of danger and urgency.
