THE WALKING DEAD #11 by Tony Moore, a group of grotesque, undead creatures emerges from a dimly lit barn, their eyes glowing menacingly. In the foreground, a man and a child sleep peacefully under a quilt, unaware of the impending danger. A chained hook hangs overhead, adding to the eerie atmosphere.
