Wild Ride by Doug Beekman. A muscular warrior, wielding a large axe and a round shield, rides a golden horse amidst a chaotic battlefield. The warrior's intense expression and dynamic pose suggest he's in the midst of a fierce confrontation. In the background, a massive, glowing orb looms, casting an ethereal light over the battlefield, while ethereal creatures float in the sky.
