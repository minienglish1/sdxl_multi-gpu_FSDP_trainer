TITANS #17 by Brett Booth, two superheroes, one in red and the other in blue, battle amidst a fiery backdrop. The red-clad hero is in a defensive posture, while the blue-clad hero wields a blue energy-infused weapon. Debris flies around them, and a large, destroyed structure looms in the background.
