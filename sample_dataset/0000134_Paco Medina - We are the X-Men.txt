The cover of 'We are the X-Men' by Paco Medina prominently features two X-Men characters, one male and one female, in dynamic poses. The male character, on the left, is leaping forward with a determined expression, while the female character, on the right, is poised in a defensive stance. The background is filled with other X-Men characters in various action poses. The title 'We are the X-Men' is boldly displayed at the top, with the Marvel logo at the bottom.
