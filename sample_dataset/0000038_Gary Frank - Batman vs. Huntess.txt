Batman vs. Huntess by Gary Frank. a cemetery shrouded in rain, Batman and Huntess engage in a fierce battle. Batman, clad in his iconic black suit with a red emblem on his chest, lunges forward, his cape billowing in the wind. Huntess, dressed in a sleek blue outfit with red accents, flies through the air, her hair wild and untamed, delivering a powerful punch. Gravestones dot the background, and the atmosphere is charged with tension.
