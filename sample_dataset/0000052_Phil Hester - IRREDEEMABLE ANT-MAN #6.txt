IRREDEEMABLE ANT-MAN. RREDEEMABLE ANT-MAN #6 by Phil Hester. In a chaotic urban setting, Ant-Man, clad in his signature red and black suit, crouches amidst debris, signaling distress with his hand. Above him, a colossal, fragmented letter 'A' looms ominously. In the foreground, two menacing figures, one with dark hair and the other with slicked-back hair, appear to be confronting or chasing Ant-Man.
