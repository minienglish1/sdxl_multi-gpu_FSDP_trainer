LEGIONNAIRES #65 by Jeff Moy, a group of diverse superheroes, each with unique powers and appearances, come together against a backdrop of shattered rocks and a radiant yellow aura. The central figure, a blonde male with a star emblem on his chest, stands prominently, surrounded by other characters, including a green-skinned giant, a woman with a red eye, and a blue-skinned male. The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
