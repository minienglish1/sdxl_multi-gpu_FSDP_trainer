X-MEN #27 by Jorge Molina, a group of superheroes and villains are depicted in an intense battle. The X-Men, including a green-skinned mutant, a purple-haired woman in a blue outfit, and a black-clad woman, are armed and ready for combat. On the other side, there's a villainous character with a white mask and another with a green mask, both wielding weapons. Snowflakes fall, and the atmosphere is charged with action.
