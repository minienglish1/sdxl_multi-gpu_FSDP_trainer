Wonder Woman #184 by Adam Hughes, the iconic superhero is depicted in two contrasting poses. On the left, she stands confidently in her classic red and blue costume, brandishing her golden lasso. On the right, she is seen in a more relaxed pose, wearing a red and blue outfit with a star-patterned mini-skirt. Behind her, two menacing-looking villains are shown, one with a mustache and the other with a goatee. The cover has a vintage feel, with faded colors and a price tag of 25 cents.
