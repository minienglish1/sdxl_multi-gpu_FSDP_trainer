X-O MANOWAR #5 by Lee Garbett, a blue-armored figure confronts a man wielding a knife in a dense forest setting. The blue-armored figure uses a 'PAFF' sound effect, presumably from a device on his wrist, to disarm the man. The man, in a state of panic, exclaims, 'Begging! I'll kill you!'. In the subsequent panels, we see the aftermath of the confrontation with the blue-armored figure standing over a fallen man.
