Hellblazer by Simon Bisley. A man with intense, fiery eyes wields a welding torch, creating an electrifying display of sparks and energy. He wears a protective mask and overalls, and is surrounded by industrial machinery. The background is dominated by a deep green hue, contrasting with the vibrant blue and orange of the welding flames.
