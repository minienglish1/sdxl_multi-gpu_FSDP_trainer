Sunny Lee's rendition of Batman's Rogues Gallery features the iconic superhero in the center, flanked by eight notorious adversaries. From the top left, we see the Joker laughing maniacally, followed by the Riddler with his signature puzzles, the Penguin in a sleek suit, Poison Ivy in a seductive pose, Two-Face with his distinctive dual-faced appearance, the Riddler again with a different puzzle, and finally, the Scarecrow with his fear-inducing mask.
